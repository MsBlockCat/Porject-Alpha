# Porject Alpha
Our very epic, Choose Your Own Adventure style game with custom ASCII artwork and a lot of game play!

To play Porject Alpha, download this repository and open it in a Java IDE. In terms of what Java IDE to use, in our experience DrJava doesn't work, and Eclipse works. Other IDEs haven't been tested. As such it's recommended you use Eclipse whether on macOS or Windows. When you open it in your Java IDE of choice make sure to make the place the IDE looks the main "Porject-Alpha" folder, not "src", "Game Code", or any other folder. Otherwise, saving/loading and credits won't work properly. To start, run Porject-Alpha/Game Code/src/PorjectAlpha.java in the IDE! For more info on how to play once in game please see [How to Play](https://github.com/MsBlockCat/Porject-Alpha/wiki/How-To-Play) in our wiki.
